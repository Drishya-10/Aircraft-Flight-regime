This project include a synthetic dataset which include different parameters that can be used for classification
Random Forest algorithm have been used and a perfect accuracy have been obtained
Visualization of the flight regime has also been performed
User input value and real time values can also be fed-up inorder to find out the aircraft regime at a particular point
